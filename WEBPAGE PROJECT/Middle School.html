<p> Going into Middle School, I continued my education at The Walker School. I continued to play club level soccer as well as joined many clubs at the school.
I got involved in the Spanish Club, Latin Club, Fellowship of Christian Athletes Club, as well as played on the Cross Country, Soccer, and Basketball teams. 
I was a member of the Junior Beta Club as well. I was awarded Most Outstanding Runner for all three years of Cross Country and Most Valuable Player for both
