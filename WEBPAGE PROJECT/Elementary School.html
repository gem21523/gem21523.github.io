<p> Going into Elementary School, I still attended The Walker School and my mom started teaching in the Fourth Grade. 
During this time, I made some of my best friends and learned basic skills such as cursive and math operations. Outside of school, 
I joined a higher level of soccer and took a few tennis lessons. These were the years where I lost all of my baby teeth and got 
braces in the Fifth Grade. By the end of Fifth Grade, I had already learned how to switch classes rather than stay put in the 
same classroom all day. At my Fifth Grade Graduation, I was awarded the Yellow Slicker Award, an award given to a student that stood
out in terms of community service and giving back to the school community.</p>
