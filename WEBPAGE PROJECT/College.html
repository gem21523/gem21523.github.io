<p> I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia as an intended Accounting major as well as a resident of Russell Hall. 
I am involved in Greek Life as a Phi Mu and play on their soccer and basketball intramural sports teams.
In UGA Miracle, I am the Morale Chair of the Green Team of the Ignite Committee. I plan on getting
more involved as I move through this university as more opportunities open up to me. </p>
